        ## Before you continue...

        Please help us by asking yourself these questions first:

        - Is this clearly a BeAPI defect?

        - Do I have basic ideas about where it goes wrong? (For example, if
        there are stack traces, are they pointing at the core script?)

        - Could it be because of my own mistakes?


        **The GitHub issue tracker is not a support forum.** If you are not sure
        whether it could be your mistakes, ask in the [Discord
        Guild](https://discord.gg/DPRYsU4yf4). The quickest way to verify
        whether it's a BeAPI defect is through a **reproduction**, starting with
        a fresh installation and making changes until the bug is reproduced.


        Make the bug obvious. Ideally, we should be able to understand it
        without running any code.


        Bugs are fixed faster if you include:

        - A reproduction repository to inspect the code

        - A video displaying the bug in action (if feasible)

        Paste the link to an example repository with the code to reproduce the
        bug. The repository should include everything given in the scaffold
        template plus any extra files needed to reproduce the bug. 

        > **What happens if you skip this step?** Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you, but it's unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually, the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.

        Please remember that:

        - Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.
        - The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
        - You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

        Thanks for helping us help you!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First off, welcome to BeAPI's first release üéâ
Thank you for sticking with us and helping us
contemplate ideas for this package. It sure
has been an intriguing journey up to this point.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="BeAPI Logo" src="/BeAPI/assets/images/beapi-4603cf2680132a588e928408bdbe7851.png" width="1280" height="640"></p><p>Now with that aside...</p><p>It's 3:45 in the morning, and I just finished
writing all the docs out for this bad boy
<em>after procrastinating and playing Walkabout Mini Golf with some friends.</em></p><p>Let me say; Writing documentation truly makes
you contemplate life: "why am I here?",
"How did I get here?", "Can I go to bed now?".
BUT NO... I feel like a freaking world war translator
decrypting massive files of gibberish written by my
peers with no help.</p><p>I was ultimately planning on removing the blogs page from
this website. My mindset at the time was something along the
lines of: "You've got me <!-- -->*<!-- -->*<!-- -->*<!-- -->*<!-- -->*<!-- -->*<!-- --> up if you think I am going to
write more words!"</p><p>BUT After briefly reconsidering, I figured maybe posting here
would be fun, thus my resolve to write this.</p><p>Anyways, even though BeAPI is released to the public fully now,
I do want to warn, we are going to violate semver a bit. We
made some changes to the beta branch we meant to push to production,
but we got ahead of ourselves accidentally and made a release.</p><p>I'll probably end up just throwing changes like that in a migration
guide or something when I decide to add version management to the docs.</p><p>_</p><p>I suppose that is all I have for this first post. I apologize if it's
a bit bland, but you should probably cut me some slack; It's now 4:00 in
the morning, and my brain is deep-fried.</p><p>Once again, thank you very much all for the continued
support we love ya ‚ù§Ô∏è <em>no homo... or maybe not?</em> üò≥</p>]]></content:encoded>

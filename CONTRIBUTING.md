# Contributing
BeAPI is an open source project and we encourage everyone to help contribute to make the best GameTest API there is to offer.

## Workflow
Our development branch will always be listed as `beta` and our production branch will be listed as `production`.

When making a PR create a new branch from `beta` and commit your changes there. Our developers will review it and if all checks out it will be
merged into `beta`. Once time comes for update `beta` will be merged into `production` and you'll see your updates there.

When changing anything major we ask that you open an issue first to discuss what you'd like to change, otherwise, features/bugfixes are
free to be pull requested without prior discussion.
